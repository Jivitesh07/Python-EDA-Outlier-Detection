Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Key Findings

Dataset: House Prices

1. The dataset contains 10 housing records with features related to area, bedrooms, price, and age. No missing or duplicate values were found.

2. Descriptive analysis shows that house prices increase with larger area and more bedrooms. Price and Area_sqft exhibit right-skewed distributions with a few high-value outliers.

3. Outliers were identified using the IQR method, primarily in Area_sqft and Price. These outliers were handled using capping to maintain data integrity while reducing skewness.

4. Correlation analysis indicates a strong positive relationship between Area_sqft and Price, and a moderate correlation between Bedrooms and Price. Age shows a weak negative correlation with price.

5. Conclusion:
House price is mainly influenced by property size and number of bedrooms. The cleaned dataset is suitable for further analysis and modeling.
